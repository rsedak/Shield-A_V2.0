Introduction
============

![Shield application](images/shield-a_v2.0_01.png)
Shield-A v2.0 is version of Arduino Uno based shield for student education compatible with BASCOM-AVR(C) and Arduino IDE.
During programming please keep in mind next design rules:
- D0-D7 — LEDs can be used only if D12 is set to OUTPUT HIGH state
- LCD 1602 — can be used only if A3 is set to OUTPUT HIGH state
- RGB LED — are connected in matrix (D5-D7 - colors; D8-D11 - LEDs)
- D12 — enables D0-D7 LEDs
- D13 — reserved for buzzer
- A0 — reserved for potentiometer
- A1,A2 — reserved for switch in INPUT_PULLUP mode
- A3 — enables LCD 1602 back-light
- A4,A5 — reserved for I2C communication with on board pull-up resistors
